`ekege` is an E-graph library for Rust. Essentially, a reimplementation of an [`egglog`](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog)-like system. It sports less features, and is less developed. Eventual plans are to make it faster than [`egglog`](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egglog), with support for free variables.
